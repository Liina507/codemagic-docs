**Codecov** is a dedicated code analysis tool and one of the leading code coverage solutions for mobile applications. **Codecov** can be used as part of the Codemagic CI/CD pipeline for code coverage. 

## Create a Codecov account

In order to get a dedicate Codecov token, signing up is required. You can sign up for free [here](https://about.codecov.io/): 

## Configuring Codecov Code Coverage Upload:

Code coverages can be submitted to the Codecov environment through Codemagic using a **cURL** request. In order to configure it correctly, codecov token is required and it can be found under the Codecov account after signing up. After getting the necessary token, it can be assigned to an enviornment variable. Environment variables can be added in the Codemagic web app using the ‘Environment variables’ tab. You can then and import your variable groups into your codemagic.yaml. For example, if you named your variable group ‘browserstack_credentials’, you would import it as follows:

```
workflows:
  workflow-name:
    environment:
      groups:
        - codecov_token

```

For further information about using variable groups please click [here](https://docs.codemagic.io/variables/environment-variable-groups/).


Codecov uses a separate upload tool to make it easy to upload coverage reports to Codecov for processing. cURL request changes depending on what build machine is used:

**Mac**:
```
curl -Os https://uploader.codecov.io/latest/macos/codecov
chmod +x codecov
./codecov -t ${CODECOV_TOKEN}
```
**Windows**:
```
$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://uploader.codecov.io/latest/windows/codecov.exe 
-Outfile codecov.exe
 .\codecov.exe -t ${CODECOV_TOKEN}
```
**Linux**
```
curl -Os https://uploader.codecov.io/latest/linux/codecov
chmod +x codecov
./codecov -t ${CODECOV_TOKEN}
```

Codecov centrally ingests **.xml** **.json** and **.txt** type coverage report formats. You can display test results visually in the build overview by adding them to a path. Just include the **test_report** field with a glob pattern matching the test result file location. More information can be found [here](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-testing/testing/) along with its samples.
